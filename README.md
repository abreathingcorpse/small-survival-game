The theme for the game being The Dark Side

The premise is that you are a cold made being, like an iceman or a
snowman. I'm thinking it's going to be anaerobic, although I'm not
too sure whether that's actually relevant or not.

Your character lives on a planet with changing daily weather.
Therefore you can only live on the dark side of the planet. Which is
why your character is nomad and will need to be traveling constantly
to the right side of the screen, in order to avoid the heat.
